# Malariares2025
After my first malaria publication ["Eradicating Malaria in Africa: Potentials and Challenges of Vaccine Deployment"](https://bjbabs.org/index.php/bjbabs/article/view/318), i was moved to initiate a project on malaria eradication by applying bioinfomatics approach. I need to see firsthand what is happening in the genome, identify and analyze genomic variants and observe any disparity in circulation? Finally, how does my findings inform policy and decision making.
