# Malariares2025
After the publication ["Eradicating Malaria in Africa: Potentials and Challenges of Vaccine Deployment"](https://bjbabs.org/index.php/bjbabs/article/view/318), i was motivated to initiate this project on malaria eradication by applying bioinformatics approaches. I need to see first-hand what is happening in the genome of the parasite, identify and analyze genomic variants and observe any disparity in circulation? Finally, how does my findings inform policy and decision making.
