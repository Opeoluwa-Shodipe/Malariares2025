# Malaria and Antimalarial Drug Resistance

## INTRODUCTION
Malaria is a blood-borne protozoan parasitic infection spread by female *Anopheles* mosquitos, resulting in significant morbidity and fatality rates (Kweyamba *et al.*, 2019). Malaria control in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains challenging, despite ongoing efforts. In 2020, 85 endemic countries reported 241 million malaria cases, up from 227 million in 2019. The bulk of these cases occurred in the World Health Organization's (WHO) African Region. Malaria deaths increased from 558,000 to 627,000 (Chemwor *et al.*, 2023). *Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale*, and *P. knowlesi* are the five species of *Plasmodium* that may cause malaria in humans.

Approximately 94% of these cases were in the WHO African Region, where *Plasmodium falciparum* was the primary malaria species. In 2023, there were a projected 597,000 malaria-related fatalities (World Health Organization, 2024). In order to effectively treat patients with malaria, *Plasmodium* parasites must be diagnosed, and after a diagnosis, effective antimalarial medications must be administered (World Health Organization, 2023; Quan *et al.*, 2020).

The World Health Organization defines drug resistance as a parasite strain (*P. falciparum*) that can continue to live and/or multiply even after a drug is administered and absorbed in doses that are within the subject's tolerance but higher than those typically advised. *Plasmodium falciparum* resistance to antimalarial medications is one of the biggest challenges in the battle against malaria, particularly when it comes to the prevention and elimination of the parasites (Bhagavathula, 2020; Fenta & Kahaliw, 2019).

The effectiveness of antimalarial medications is crucial for patient care, and their failure because of parasite resistance will have a major impact on patient care and recuperation (Quan *et al.*, 2020). As the gold standard, therapeutic efficacy studies are used to track the effectiveness of antimalarial medications. To differentiate between treatment failures resulting from reinfection and those resulting from recrudescence, these investigations use PCR techniques. The molecular monitoring of genetic alterations linked to decreased drug sensitivity may also be used to evaluate antimalarial drug resistance (World Health Organization, 2023; Gupta *et al.*, 2017).

Combinations of an artemisinin derivative and a related medication are known as artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs). In addition to the accompanying medicine working as a second longer-lasting medication that eradicates the parasites that survive artemisinin and cause recrudescence, the artemisinin component functions as a potent short-acting medication that quickly lowers parasitemia. Globally, ACTs are advised as the first-line antimalarial treatment (Su *et al.*, 2019). Low levels of artemisinin resistance have been found in Africa (Uwimana, 2020), while *P. falciparum* that is resistant to the drug is well-established in Southeast Asia (Ashley *et al.*, 2014). Because of the high rate of malaria in the WHO African area, the establishment of artemisinin partial resistance is significant (World malaria report, 2022).

An established list of candidates (related with delayed parasite clearance alone) and verified (associated with delayed parasite clearance in patients and in vitro/ex vivo confirmation) PfKelch13 markers (*pfk13*) is used to track partial artemisinin resistance, as described by Ashley *et al.* (2014), World Health Organization (2023), and Daily (2016). A number of point mutations in the *pfk13* gene (F446I, N458Y, C469Y, M476I, Y493H, R539T, I543T, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y, R622I, and A675V) have been shown to correlate with clinical artemisinin resistance, as demonstrated by Daily (2016), Ménard *et al.* (2016), and World Health Organization (2024).

In Nigeria, a prior publication (Tola *et al.*, 2020) used a particular real-time PCR test to identify two suspected samples with C580Y mixed alleles (wild type and mutant); however, Sanger sequencing against the reference strain *P. falciparum* 3D7 could not confirm the mutant type allele. C580Y may reduce the binding ability to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which *in vitro* increases resistance to artemisinin (Mbengue *et al.*, 2015; Azmi *et al.*, 2023). In Nigeria, the nation with the largest number of malaria cases and fatalities among malaria endemic countries, this study may raise concerns about artemisinin resistance (World Health Organization, 2023). Furthermore, 13 mutations were found in the same or nearby location to confirm or suggest *pfk13* markers. Future research must closely monitor and evaluate the polymorphisms since they suggest instability in these genomic areas, which may have an impact on artemisinins' antimalarial effectiveness (Taylor *et al.*, 2015; Molina-de la Fuente *et al.*, 2023).
