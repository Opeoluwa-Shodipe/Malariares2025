# Malaria and Antimalarial Drug Resistance

## INTRODUCTION

Malaria is a blood-borne protozoan parasitic infection transmitted by female *Anopheles* mosquitoes, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality (Kweyamba et al., 2019). Malaria control in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains challenging, despite ongoing efforts (Mendoza et al., 2019). In 2020, 85 endemic countries reported 241 million malaria cases, up from 227 million in 2019 (Megersa & Luo, 2025). The bulk of these cases occurred in the World Health Organization's (WHO) African Region. Malaria deaths increased from 558,000 to 627,000 (Chemwor et al., 2023).

Approximately 94% of these cases were in the WHO African Region, where *Plasmodium falciparum* was the primary malaria species. In 2023, there were an estimated 597,000 malaria-related deaths (World Health Organization, 2024). In order to effectively treat patients with malaria, *Plasmodium* parasites must be diagnosed, and after a diagnosis, effective antimalarial medications must be administered (Quan et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2023).

*Plasmodium falciparum* resistance to antimalarial medications is one of the biggest challenges in the battle against malaria, particularly when it comes to the prevention and elimination of the parasites (Fenta & Kahaliw, 2019; Bhagavathula, 2020). The effectiveness of antimalarial medications is crucial for patient care, and their failure because of parasite resistance will have a major impact on patient care and recuperation (Quan et al., 2020). To differentiate between treatment failures resulting from reinfection and those resulting from recrudescence, these investigations use PCR techniques. The molecular monitoring of genetic alterations linked to decreased drug sensitivity may also be used to evaluate antimalarial drug resistance (Gupta et al., 2017; World Health Organization, 2023).

Malaria is now treated using artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs), such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AA). These medications have been routinely used to treat *falciparum* malaria worldwide since the World Health Organization (WHO) approved them as the first-line therapy for uncomplicated *falciparum* malaria in 2001 (World Health Organization, 2020). Low levels of artemisinin resistance have been found in Africa (Uwimana, 2020), while *P. falciparum* that is resistant to the drug is well-established in Southeast Asia (Ashley et al., 2014). Because of the high rate of malaria in the WHO African area, the establishment of artemisinin partial resistance is significant (World malaria report, 2022).

A number of point mutations in the *pfk13* gene (F446I, N458Y, C469Y, M476I, Y493H, R539T, I543T, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y, R622I, and A675V) have been shown to correlate with clinical artemisinin resistance have been validated to correlate with clinical ART resistance in Southeast Asia and South America (Ajogbasile et al., 2022).

In Nigeria, the nation with the largest number of malaria cases and fatalities among malaria endemic countries, this study may raise concerns about artemisinin resistance (World Health Organization, 2023). Furthermore, 13 mutations were found in the same or nearby location to confirm or suggest *pfk13* markers. Ongoing research is essential to monitor these polymorphisms, as their presence may indicate genomic instability and could compromise the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives (Taylor et al., 2015; Molina-de la Fuente et al., 2023).
